IV. AIRPORT WORKERS WAGE POLICY

A. Background of Airport Workers Wage Policy

In 2016, the Authority’s Board of Directors \(“Board”\) initiated a review of the levels of compensation that certain businesses operating on Ronald Reagan or Dulles International Airport were providing their on-Airport workers. The Board formed a special committee to undertake the review and to submit recommendations to the Board. The special committee conducted this review, during which it obtained input from airlines, concessionaires, labor organizations and airport workers, and received briefings from Authority staff. This work culminated in a committee report which recommended that the Board adopt an Airport Workers Wage Policy, as outlined in the committee report. On April 19, 2017, the Board accepted the special committee’s recommendation and adopted Resolution No. 17-8 in which it formally adopted the Airport Workers Wage Policy.

In June 2019, the Board formed a special committee to conduct a review of the Airport Workers Wage Policy and on December 18, 2019, that committee recommended, and the Board adopted in Resolution No. 19-24, amendments to the Airports Workers Wage Policy, including updated Base Wage Rates and expanded definitions of Covered Businesses and Covered Workers.
